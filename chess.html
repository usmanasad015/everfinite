                                <p>Chess was first originated in India around the 6th century by a person named
                                    Chaturanga. It is one of the most popular indoor games for two players.</p>
                                <p>It consists of a chessboard and six unique pieces, includes King, Queen, Rook,
                                    Bishop, Knight, and Pawn. Each player has 16 of them, including 8 Pawns, 2 Rooks, 2
                                    Knights, 2 Bishops, 1 Queen, and 1 King.</p>
                                <p>In this guide, you will learn about how to play chess following all the rules
                                    properly.</p>
                                <h2>How to Play Chess</h2>
                                <p>Before starting a game, you should know basic chess rules. You should know the proper
                                    chessboard layout, pieces roles with their moves, and situations to win or draw a
                                    game.</p>
                                <h3>Place the Chess Board Correctly</h3>
                                <p>A chessboard should be arranged in a proper way to enjoy perfect gameplay. But you
                                    may don’t know <a
                                        href="https://www.www.everfinite.com/2021/08/chess-board-setup.html"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to set up a chess board</a>.</p>
                                <p>A correct way to do so is by placing white squares on the right. Such that, for each
                                    player, the light square should be at the bottom right corner.</p>
                                <p>After placing the chessboard, place all pawns at the second rank on the board. Then
                                    place Rooks at both corners. Place knights next to the rooks and bishops as
                                    neighbors on both sides. The two squares left are for Queen and King, such that a
                                    queen goes on the same color, and the king occupies the only place left behind.</p>
                                <h3>Start with White</h3>
                                <p>The chessboard square and pieces have two colors, light and dark (generally white and
                                    black). The white always moves first, and then the other takes the turn. Then the
                                    game proceeds according to the rules.</p>
                                <h3>Move Pieces According to the Rules</h3>
                                <h4>Pawn</h4>
                                <p>A pawn can move just one square. However, it can move either one or two squares on
                                    the very first move. It can only capture the piece in the diagonal and cannot move
                                    backward.</p>

                                <p>Pawn has a special ability to get promoted when it reaches 8th rank (line). You can
                                    promote it to any piece you want. You can even get up to nine queens or eight any
                                    desired pieces.</p>
                                <br> <br>

                                <p>Bishop can only move diagonally. However, it can move any number of squares on the
                                    board while no other piece is blocking the way.</p>

                                <p>Queen can move anywhere following a combined pattern of all other pieces except the
                                    knight. She can move any number of squares forwards, backward, sideways, and
                                    diagonally.</p>

                                <h4>King</h4>
                                <p>King can move in all directions but only one square in a single move. However, it
                                    cannot move in any of the surrounding squares of the opponent king. Because, as per
                                    rule, the king can not move to a square where it can get checked.</p>

                                <h3>Give a Check</h3>
                                <p>Check means that the opponent has attacked your king. You have to move out of the
                                    check on the very next move. Otherwise, you cannot continue the game.</p>
                                <p>You can try the following techniques to get out of the check.</p>
                                <ol style="text-align: left;">
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Move the king to a safe square where it gets out of the attack.&nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Capture the piece from which the king is getting checked.&nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>Block the attack with one of your pieces.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </ol>
                                <p>If you are unable to remove the check using these techniques, you will lose the game.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Checkmate Opponent</h3>
                                <p>Each player needs to checkmate the other to win the game, where the king gets
                                    captured, and the opponent has no move left to save the king.</p>
                                <p>You also have to support the piece with whom you are giving checks. It will be a plus
                                    point and benefit you.</p>
                                <h3>Win the Game</h3>
                                <p>Chess is the game of intelligence and strategy. You have to checkmate the opponent
                                    with a move that the opponent cannot foresee. It requires a proper technique with
                                    good thinking and intelligence.</p>
                                <p>There are many strategies to capture the king. You can apply Queen’s gambit, English
                                    opening, the four knights game, and other strategies to win a game. More strategies
                                    you master, the higher the chance to win.</p>
                                <h3>Draw Conditions</h3>
                                <p>The draw means that both players have agreed to tie. In tournaments, both players get
                                    0.5 (1/2) points if there is a tie.</p>
                                <p>There are some conditions when the game can be declared a draw.</p>
                                <h4>Stalemate</h4>
                                <p>It happens when a player makes a move that is not giving a check, but the other
                                    player got no option left with either king or other pieces. It is one of the biggest
                                    reasons to get a match draw.</p>
                                <h4>Mutual Agreement</h4>
                                <p>Players can draw the match by mutual agreement. Such that a player can offer a draw
                                    to the opponent player at any time during the game. If the player accepts it, the
                                    game will be declared a draw, and each player gets awarded half points.</p>
                                <h4>Threefold Repetition</h4>
                                <p>If the same position occurs thrice, the game will be declared drawn. Such a situation
                                    is called threefold repetition.</p>
                                <p>For example, if players move the knight three times here and there, the game will be
                                    declared a draw. In modern chess, fivefold repetition is also considered the same
                                    way the threefold is.</p>
                                <h4>50 Move Rule</h4>
                                <p>If both players don’t move a pawn or do not capture any single piece for consecutive
                                    50 moves, then you can claim a draw. In modern chess, the same rule is applied for
                                    75 moves, called the 75 move rule.</p>
                                <h4>Dead Position</h4>
                                <p>When a situation occurs in which no player can give checkmate to the opponent with a
                                    valid move, the game will be a draw. Such a situation is called a dead position.</p>
                                <p>It usually occurs when both the players have no material left to checkmate the king.
                                    Such that there would be only two kings remaining on the board.</p>
